## Python is a powerful and popular programming language widely used for data science, data visualization, web development, game development, machine learning and more

In this project, you'll learn fundamental programming concepts in Python, such as variables, functions, loops, and conditional statements. You'll use these to code your first programs.

## Step 1

Variables are an essential part of Python and any programming language. A variable is a name that references or points to an object. You can declare a variable by writing the variable name on the left side of the assignment operator = and specifying the value to assign to that variable on the right side of the assignment operator:

```csharp
variable_name = value
```

Create a variable called number and assign the value 5 to your new variable.

## Step 2

Variables can store values of different data types. You just assigned an integer value, but if you want to represent some text, you need to assign a string. Strings are sequences of characters enclosed by single or double quotes, but you cannot start a string with a single quote and end it with a double quote or vice versa:

```csharp
string_1 = "I am a string"
string_2 = 'I am also a string'
string_3 = 'This is not valid"
```

Delete your number variable and its value. Then, declare another variable called text and assign the string 'Hello World' to this variable.

```csharp
number = 5
```
